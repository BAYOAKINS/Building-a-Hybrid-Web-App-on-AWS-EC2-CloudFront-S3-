# Building-a-Hybrid-Web-App-on-AWS-EC2-CloudFront-S3-
For this project, my goal was to design and deploy a simple hybrid web architecture in which an EC2 instance serves HTML, while S3 and CloudFront deliver static assets securely and efficiently. This hands-on build reinforced core AWS architectural principles in networking, security, and performance optimization.
