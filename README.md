# Building-a-Hybrid-Web-App-on-AWS-EC2-CloudFront-S3-
For this project, my goal was to design and deploy a simple hybrid web architecture in which an EC2 instance serves HTML, while S3 and CloudFront deliver static assets securely and efficiently. This hands-on build reinforced core AWS architectural principles in networking, security, and performance optimization. 
This hands-on build helped me apply architectural reasoning rather than just service configuration. Working through each step deepened my understanding of how AWS services integrate — especially when designing secure, cost-optimized, and scalable web applications.
Next, I plan to extend this architecture with:
•	HTTPS configuration
•	Route 53 DNS mapping
•	Lambda@Edge caching logic
Each improvement brings the build closer to production readiness — and one step further in my AWS Solutions Architect journey.
